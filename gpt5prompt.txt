Evaluating cryptocurrency positions

I need to output JSON for each coin I’m managing, which are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. The instructions specify that if a position is open, I can only choose 'hold' or 'close_position'. I must evaluate each position carefully based on specific invalidation conditions. For ETH, I’ll close early if a 4-hour candle closes below 3920 and the MACD histogram decreases for two consecutive bars. I need to check if these conditions are met. Analyzing positions for invalidation

The current price is 3954.65 with the 4-hour EMA20 at 3884 and EMA50 at 3927, indicating a trend. The MACD series shows it's increasing, so the invalidation conditions aren't met. Therefore, I’ll hold ETH.

For SOL, the price is 191.635, and the MACD trend is also increasing, so invalidation doesn’t apply; I’ll hold.

XRP's price is 2.44975, and since the MACD series is increasing with no close below 2.40, I'll hold that position too.

BTC's invalidation threshold is a close below 108500. Assessing positions and conditions

The current price is 111153.5, and the 4-hour MACD shows a strong increase up to 291.464, meaning not invalidated; I’ll hold.

For DOGE, the invalidation requires a candle close below 0.183 and a negative MACD for two consecutive bars. The series indicates it's not negative, and the price is above 0.183, so I’ll hold that too.

The BNB price is at 1124.05, and since it’s also not invalidated, I’ll hold that position as well.

Finally, I must include the profit_target, stop_loss, and invalidation_condition in the hold JSON, matching the exit_plan. However, for XRP, I see that the sl_oid and tp_oid values are marked as -1, which indicates they're missing. Creating a unified JSON object

The exit plan indicates a profit_target of 2.5004 and a stop_loss of 2.409, which is good. For ETH, the targets are 4040 and 3924; for SOL, they’re 201.333 and 188.987; and for BNB, they’re 1176.15 and 1083.04.

I need to include leverage, risk_usd, and confidence for each, using the existing fields. The quantity should match the full current size.

I’ll create a unified JSON object that includes each coin I hold: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, and BNB.

I need to ensure that the leverage is between 5 and 40. Preparing final JSON output

I’ll use the current leverage for each position: ETH at 25, SOL at 15, XRP at 20, BTC at 20, DOGE at 10, and BNB at 10. I’ll keep the existing confidence and risk_usd values.

For XRP and DOGE, where the sl_oid and tp_oid were -1, stops and targets might not be set, but I’ll still include the exit plan parameters. There is no need to provide justifications in the hold structure.

So, for each coin, I’ll ensure the proper format and numeric fields. Here’s the finalized JSON for all six positions, following the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd.
