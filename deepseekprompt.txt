CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT
First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All are long positions.

For each coin, I must decide whether to hold or close the position based on the invalidation condition and current market state.

Starting with ETH:

Current price: 3952.35

Entry price: 3794.9

Unrealized PnL: +489.67

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 3700 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 4005.042, Stop loss: 3682.104

Current EMA20: 3955.679, MACD: -1.237, RSI7: 39.811

Price is above entry and near EMA20. MACD is negative but not dramatically so. RSI is around 40, not oversold. No invalidation triggered. I should hold.

SOL:

Current price: 191.565

Entry price: 182.8

Unrealized PnL: +717.06

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 175 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 201.081, Stop loss: 176.713

Current EMA20: 191.869, MACD: -0.291, RSI7: 38.241

Price is above entry and near EMA20. MACD slightly negative. RSI below 40, might be oversold but not too bad. No invalidation. Hold.

XRP:

Current price: 2.44915

Entry price: 2.44

Unrealized PnL: +15.7

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 2.30 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 2.815, Stop loss: 2.325

Current EMA20: 2.451, MACD: -0.001, RSI7: 42.578

Price is very close to entry, slightly above. EMA20 is at 2.451, almost same as price. MACD flat. RSI around 42. No invalidation. Small PnL, but no reason to close. Hold.

BTC:

Current price: 111119.5

Entry price: 107343.0

Unrealized PnL: +453.18

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 118136.15, Stop loss: 102026.675

Current EMA20: 111217.428, MACD: -21.624, RSI7: 32.767

Price is above entry but below EMA20. MACD is negative and large, indicating bearish momentum. RSI is 32.76, which is oversold. However, invalidation is at 105000, which is far below. Profit target is 118136, still above. No invalidation. Hold, but watch for bearish signs.

DOGE:

Current price: 0.196665

Entry price: 0.18

Unrealized PnL: +336.83

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 0.180 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 0.212275, Stop loss: 0.175355

Current EMA20: 0.197, MACD: -0.0, RSI7: 39.909

Price is above entry, near EMA20. MACD flat. RSI around 40. No invalidation. Hold.

BNB:

Current price: 1123.75

Entry price: 1143.54

Unrealized PnL: -318.62 (loss)

Exit plan: Invalidation if price closes below 1100 on 3-min candle. Profit target: 1250.0, Stop loss: 1086.32

Current EMA20: 1126.665, MACD: -1.168, RSI7: 27.999

Price is below entry, and EMA20 is above price. MACD negative. RSI is 27.99, which is oversold. Invalidation is at 1100, current price is 1123.75, so not triggered yet. But RSI oversold might indicate potential bounce or further drop. No invalidation, so hold.

Now, for new entries. I have positions in all coins, so I cannot enter new ones in the same coin. The instructions say: "If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'." So no new entries for coins I'm already in.

I need to check if there are any coins not in my positions, but all tradable coins ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'] are already in my positions. So no new entries possible.

I must output JSON for each coin I act on or hold. Since I'm holding all, I need to output 'hold' for each.

For each coin, in the 'hold' signal, I need to provide the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These are already provided in the account information.

I should use the values from the exit_plan and other details for each coin.

Also, for justification, only entry and close signals have justification in the JSON. For hold, no justification is needed in the output, as per the JSON structure.

Looking at the JSON for hold:

{ "COIN": { "trade_signal_args": { "coin": "COIN", "signal": "hold", "quantity": <full current size>, "profit_target": <float>, "stop_loss": <float>, "invalidation_condition": "<string>", "leverage": <int 5–40>, "confidence": <0–1>,
"risk_usd": <float> } } }

No justification field for hold.

So for each coin, I need to output this with the current values.

Now, confidence and risk_usd are also provided in the account info.

Let me list out for each coin:

ETH: quantity 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24

SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504

XRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032

BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345

DOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13

BNB: quantity 16.1, profit_target 1250.0, stop_loss 1086.32, invalidation_condition "If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 925.0

I need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold'.

Also, the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.

Finally, no narration, just JSON.

So, constructing the JSON.
